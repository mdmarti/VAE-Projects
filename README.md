# VAE-Projects
this is what it sounds like! crazy how that works

## Current Projects
- VAE with smoothing prior for birdsong
- ??

## Smoothing Prior
### To Complete:
- Upload code lol
- MMD analysis
   - Implement plots:
     - UMAP of consecutive days, colored by MMD
     - Average MMD per vocalization, distribution per day. Line + scatter?
     - Average MMD per window. Line + scatter?
- Smoothness analysis
   - check L_1 distance between consecutive points - total variation
   - check squared distance
   - check sign changes
- Reconstruction of motif time
  - Forcing motif time reconstruction may help out with smoothness, spacing points further apart


### Completed:
